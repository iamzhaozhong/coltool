## Project ONE - The COLtool

Hello and welcome to my project **coltool**. The **coltool** is a simple calculation tool to help end-users conceptualize the cost of living between cities around the United States. I hope this tool can serve as a decisioning helper for those who are moving across different cities, or even just a fun little discovery tool!

#### 4. Describe your project

You are currently viewing your project's **README** file. **_README_** files are like cover pages or elevator pitches for your project. They are written in plain text or [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and usually include a paragraph describing the project, directions on how to use it, who authored it, and more.

## Your first website

**GitHub Pages** is a free and easy way to create a website using the code that lives in your GitHub repositories. You can use GitHub Pages to build a portfolio of your work, create a personal website, or share a fun project that you coded with the world. GitHub Pages is automatically enabled in this repository, but when you create new repositories in the future, the steps to launch a GitHub Pages website will be slightly different.
